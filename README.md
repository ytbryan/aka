# Aka 

aka is a development tool that generates permanent alias on the fly. 

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/aka2.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/aka2)

### Motivation
I use terminal with alias for work everyday. And I realise that to fully control my work flow, I would need to
manipulate the shortcuts in real time. Since there is no better way to control the shortcuts, I created my own.

Aka saves me time and allow me to achieve productivity through the creation of quick shortcut.
